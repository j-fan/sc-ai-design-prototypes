Ask the startup questions to begin a new prototype session:

1. Have you started the Figma desktop app with the correct frame selected?
2. What is the Figma frame link for the MCP to connect to?
3. What should we name this new prototype?
4. Is this a new prototype, or are you working on an existing one?

After getting answers, proceed with creating the prototype using the Figma MCP and design system components.
