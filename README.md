# Design Prototypes

A simple app for designers to create interactive prototypes using React components. No coding experience required to get started!

## What You Need

- A computer with Node.js installed. Install here https://nodejs.org/en
- Basic familiarity with using the terminal/command line

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Everything

Open your terminal and run this command to install all the tools needed:

```bash
pnpm install
```

*This downloads all the code libraries your app needs. You only need to do this once (or when someone adds new tools).*

## Working with Your App

### Starting Your App - `pnpm dev`

This starts your app so you can see it and make changes in real-time.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**What happens:**
- Your app opens in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`
- Every time you save a file, the page automatically updates
- Perfect for designing and testing your prototypes
